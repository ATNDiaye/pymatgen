   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

pymatgen
========

Pymatgen (python materials genomics) is the python library that powers the 
Materials Project (http://www.materialsproject.org). These are some of the main 
features:

1. Highly flexible classes for the representation of Element, Site, Structure objects.
2. Extensive io capabilities to manipulate many VASP input and output files 
   (http://cms.mpi.univie.ac.at/vasp/) and the crystallographic information file 
   format.  This includes generating Structure objects from vasp input and output.
3. Comprehensive tool to generate and view compositional and grand canonical phase 
   diagrams.
4. Electronic structure analyses (DOS and Bandstructure).

The public version of pymatgen is free (as in free beer) to download and to use. 
However, we would also like you to help us improve this library by making your 
own contributions as well.  These contributions can be in the form of additional 
tools or modules you develop, or even simple things such as bug reports.  Please 
contact the maintainer of this library (shyue@mit.edu) to find out how to include 
your contributions via github or for bug reports.

Note that pymatgen, like all scientific research, will always be a work in
progress. While the development team will always strive to avoid backward 
incompatible changes, they are sometimes unavoidable, and tough decisions have 
to be made for the long term health of the code.
